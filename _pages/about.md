I'm Iman Tabrizian MASc student at the Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE),
University of Toronto. I am broadly interested in computer systems and
networking. Specifically, about data intensive-applications and the system
challenges involved in designing platforms that need to process massive volumes
of data.
