I'm an MASc student in the <a href="https://ece.utoronto.ca">Electrical and
Computer Engineering</a> department at the <a href="https://utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>.  Currently, I'm a
member of the <a href="https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/students">Network
Architecture Lab</a> advised by <a href="https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/">
Prof. Alberto Leon-Garcia</a>. My research interests lie at the intersction of
Machine Learning and Computer Systems.</p>

My recent research projects include studying the interference effect of
co-located Machine Learning jobs in GPU clusters, quantization algorithms for
distributed deep learning, and robust gradient aggregation algorithms for
federated learning.</p>
