This talk included general information about how to get started in vim. I 
talked about some cheats in using vim. This talk was 20 minutes. The main topics
that I talked about was the modes in VIM, editing files side by side and some
basic commands in normal mode. You can find the slides in [here](https://github.com/Linuxfest/vim101).
