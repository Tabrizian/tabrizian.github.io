Many students in undergrad think the only way to explore Computer Science in graduate 
studies is by studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However,
there are many interseting areas to explore in Computer Science that many are not
aware of. Including myself, when I was trying to choose the topic that I want to 
work on for graduate studies, I wasn't aware of the interesting problems
that exist in the area of systems and networking.

In this article I want to point to out to three interesting areas in systems and networking.

# Making Datacenters Faster, Faster, and Faster!

Nowadays, datacenters and cloud computing are improving at an unprecedented speed. 
More and more workloads are being migrated to the cloud. Applications running
in cloud requirer tighter SLAs. This demands has led to research to improve
the aforementioned areas. The speed of switches and routers in data centers are 
being improved. New switches can forward packets at 100 Gb/s speed. On the other hand,
operating systems were designed for the era of dial up and KB/s speed. This design has
led to operating system being converted to the bottleneck for high speed networks. To improve
end-to-end performance of applications in cloud computing environments researchers have tried
different approaches:

## Creating Custom End-To-End Application Level Protocols

## Offloading Traffic Processing to FPGAs, GPU, and DPDK


# Systems to Improve the Performance of Machine Learning 


# Edge Computing
