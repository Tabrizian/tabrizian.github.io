Many students in undergrad think the only way to explore Computer Science in graduate 
studies is by studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However,
there are many interseting areas to explore in Computer Science that many are not
aware of. Including myself, when I was trying to choose the topic that I want to 
work on for graduate studies, I wasn't aware of the immense and interesting problems
that exist in the area of systems and networking.
